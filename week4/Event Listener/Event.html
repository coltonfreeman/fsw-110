<!--As shown in the P&P videos JS DOM manipulation is used primarily as a response to user interaction. For this assignment you will create a square and have the color of that square change by interacting with different HTML Events.

The square's color will change as follows:

White to start as a base color.
Black upon complete loading of the HTML page *you might have to look up how to do this*
Green when the mouse hovers over the square
Yellow when the mouse button is held down over the square
Blue when the mouse button is let go over the square
Red when the mouse is double clicked in the square
Purple when the mouse scroll is used somewhere in the window (not just over the square). *Try adding more content to your page with JS if you can not scroll.
You should also be able to press the first letter of the colors (typing "r" on the keyboard for "red"
